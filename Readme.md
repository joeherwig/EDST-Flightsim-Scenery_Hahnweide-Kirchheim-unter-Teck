## Quick start
Well, i just began, so at the moment you still cannot download nor use this airport for direct integration into your flight simulator.

## Big thanks
go to [Arno Gerretsen](http://www.scenerydesign.org/about/) who created and maintains some of the most advanced tools for scenery creating.
Arno, You're brilliant!

## Contributing
It would be great, if you take part on developing and improving this small VFR airfield in this very interesting landscape for publishing to the FS-community. If you want, you are invited to contribute to this repo. Just fork it, check-in your changes and send me a pull-request. See [GitHib Starting Guide](http://www.git-scm.com/documentation)
If you're not familiar with using Github you can also send me an email to inform me about the changes and additions you made, and i'll probably embed them into my repo.
